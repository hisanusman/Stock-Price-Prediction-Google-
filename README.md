# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
<br><br>
## Overview
<br><br>
This Jupyter notebook (`Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`) focuses on training an LSTM model for predicting the stock prices of Google. The process involves comprehensive data exploration, visualization, and preprocessing to ensure the robustness of the model.
<br><br>
## Contents
<br><br>
1. **Data Exploration:**<br>
   - Understanding and visualizing the dataset for insightful analysis.<br>
   - Handling missing values and creating new features from existing ones.
<br><br>
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**<br>
   - Utilizing Bayesian optimization to find the best hyperparameters for the LSTM model.<br>
   - Explaining the rationale behind choosing specific hyperparameters like epochs, batch size, dropout, and units.
<br><br>
   ```python<br>
     best = fmin(fn=objective, space=space, algo=tpe.suggest, max_evals=50, verbose=1)
   # (Refer to the notebook for detailed implementation)
   ```
<br><br>
3. **LSTM Model Training:**<br>
   - Building an LSTM model with the optimized hyperparameters.<br>
   - Training the model to achieve the best possible performance.
<br><br>
   ```python<br>
     regressor.compile(optimizer='adam',loss='mean_squared_error')
     regressor.fit(X_train,y_train,epochs=77,batch_size=16)
   # (Refer to the notebook for detailed implementation)
   ```
<br><br>
4. **Model Evaluation:**<br>
   - Visualizing the predicted and actual stock prices to assess the model's performance.
<br><br>
5. **Live Data Prediction:**<br>
   - Using the Alpha Vantage API key to fetch live stock market data.<br>
   - Applying the same preprocessing steps used during model training before predicting on live data.
<br><br>
   ```python<br>
   # (Refer to the notebook for detailed implementation)
   ```
<br><br>
## Instructions for Use
<br><br>
1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `keras`, `hyperopt`, etc.). You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
<br><br>
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially for a step-by-step understanding.
<br><br>
3. Adjust the file paths, hyperparameter ranges, and other parameters as needed for your specific use case.
<br><br>
4. Use the provided example code snippets as a reference for incorporating the model into your own projects.
<br><br>
## Additional Notes
<br><br>
- The saved LSTM model (`your_lstm_model.h5`) can be loaded using the `load_model` function in Keras for reuse in future predictions.
